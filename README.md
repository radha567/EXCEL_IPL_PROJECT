# EXCEL_IPL_PROJECT
This project presents an interactive Excel dashboard built using IPL data (2008â€“2020) to analyze team and player performances. It includes key metrics such as total runs, wickets, win percentages, strike rates, and toss outcomes. The dashboard uses PivotTables, slicers, and charts to deliver actionable insights in a user-friendly format.
